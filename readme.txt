An extensive, customisable, fully featured user tracking plugin.

== Description ==

The LBAK User Tracking plugin is a fully featured, page by page tracking plugin for your blog. Every time a page is visited on your blog, the plugin logs a whole host of information on the person who visited the page.
<br /><br />
The plugin is totally customisable from what you decide to track to what you decide you want to see. There is an optional dashboard widget included for a quick overview of recent visitors as well as a search feature for you to accurately sift through your tracking log and find the results you are looking for.
<br /><br />
<b>Data that is tracked by default:</b>
<br /><br />
-IP address (including an attempt to locate IP addresses from behind a proxy)<br />
-The HTTP referrer (what page the user was viewing before they clicked)<br />
-The time of the click<br />
-User ID<br />
-User Level (admin, editor, so on)<br />
-Display Name<br />
-Browser<br />
-Operating System<br />
-The page they visited<br />
<br /><br />
<b>Data that is not tracked by default but can be enabled:</b>
<br /><br />
