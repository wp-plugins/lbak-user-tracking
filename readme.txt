An extensive, customisable, fully featured user tracking plugin.

== Description ==

IMPORTANT NOTE: The original author of this plugin no longer supports or maintains it. If anyone wishes to take over,
please feel free to get in touch.

The LBAK User Tracking plugin is a fully featured, page by page tracking plugin for your blog. Every time a page is visited on your blog, the plugin logs a whole host of information on the person who visited the page.

The plugin is totally customisable from what you decide to track to what you decide you want to see. There is an optional dashboard widget included for a quick overview of recent visitors as well as a search feature for you to accurately sift through your tracking log and find the results you are looking for.

*Data that is tracked by default:*

* IP address (including an attempt to locate IP addresses from behind a proxy)
* The HTTP referrer (what page the user was viewing before they clicked)
* The time of the click
* User ID
* User Level (admin, editor, so on)
* Display Name
* Browser
* Operating System
* The page they visited

*Data that is not tracked by default but can be enabled:*

* GET variables
* POST variables
* Cookies
